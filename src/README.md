# Gtheme

Gtheme is **dotfile and global theme manager** for linux, written completely in Rust.

Its main goal is to **standarize and abstract from hardware specific dotfile configurations** and let you change your desktop colors with **+350 different** themes and wallpapers.

You can write some patterns with generic attributes, and the Gtheme will fill those values with the appropiate ones following the selected theme/settings

The final result you get is that you can change between any desktop of your choice with a **single command**, and also change the theme of all applications on a **centralized and automatized way**. Moreover, you can also install desktops from other people who had **already adapted their dotfiles to Gtheme** and everything will work just fine, you won't have any issues again when installing others' dotfiles.

To sum up, you can try your favourite [Unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) ricings (if authors port them to Gtheme before) with a plug'n play experience.
